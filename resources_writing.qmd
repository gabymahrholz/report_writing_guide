## Cohesion and Coherence {.unnumbered}

Cohesion and coherence are important features of academic writing. Cohesion is achieved when sentences are connected at the sentence level, whereas as coherence is achieved when ideas are connected. 

* [Cohesion](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/academic-writing/structure/){target="_blank"} Materials from the University of York. Short section on cohesion but with a link to language resources and a "what-not-to-do" example (i.e., writing without cohesion)
* [Cohesion and Coherence](https://www.eapfoundation.com/writing/cohesion/){target="_blank"} explains cohesion quite nicely and there is a comparison with coherence half-way down the page. Pretty accessible
* [Writing Flow & Coherence](https://www.port.ac.uk/student-life/help-and-advice/study-skills/written-assignments/writing-flow-and-coherence){target="_blank"} short list of transition words
* [Longer list of transition words](https://www.eapfoundation.com/writing/cohesion/transitions/){target="_blank"}
* Cambridge used to have some really good writing resources on *Writing paragraphs and linking ideas* but the link is not working anymore. I've retrieved the content via [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220618041600/https://www.transkills.admin.cam.ac.uk/resources/mml/mml-literature-essay-writing/mml-how-can-i-improve/mml-writing-paragraphs-and-linking){target="_blank"}


## PEEL paragraph structure {.unnumbered}

Different systems with different acronyms but they basically say the same thing. Address one key point per paragraph and follow a logical structure.

* PEEL structure [University of Hull](https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/grammar/paragraphs){target="_blank"}
* Similar system to PEEL with Topic Sentence (TS), Supporting Sentences (SS), and Concluding Sentence (CS) [University of Newcastle, Australia](https://libguides.newcastle.edu.au/writing-paragraphs/structure){target="_blank"} - even though they suggest that a paragraph of 250 should be around 5-6 sentences, however, that would make sentences extremely long and difficult to read, so take that sentence with a grain of salt
* Similar system to TS/SS/CS [University of York](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/academic-writing/structure/){target="_blank"} Same link as above as there is a short section on paragraph structure as well

## Confused words {.unnumbered}

* A list of confused words from [Walden University](https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/scholarlyvoice/confusedwords){target="_blank"}
