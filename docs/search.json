    "text": "Research Design Overview\nin this section you want to address your questions such as:\n\nWhy qualitative methods?\nJustification of the chosen design (why is TA the best framework for your research question?)\nSpecify the theoretical underpinnings of TA (e.g., theories of language; epistemology/ontology)\nJustification on data collection methods - why focus groups/ interviews/ social media sites/ UK data service/ …?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe justification on data collection methods could also be moved to data collection if you think it would be more logical to place it there.\n\n\nYou can cover aspects briefly if they already form part of your rationale in the introduction.\n\nTheoretical underpinnings\nTA is not a single method. It is really flexible, and can be utilised for small q and Big Q frameworks. That’s why it is super important to define your theoretical underpinnings. You can do this via Theories of language and/or the “ologies”\n\nTheories of language\n\n\nThe “Ologies”: Epistemology and Ontology\n\n\n\nWhy TA?\nThis is a really difficult section to get right. In this citical review (p. 703, point 3), Braun and Clarke mention that approximately half of the studies they reviewed did not provide any rationale that justifies the use of TA. Or descriptions were super generic that they could be easily applied to any other qual methodology.\nBraun and Clarke suggest that best practice would be to include a clear and specific rationale for the use of (the particular form of) TA, connected to the research question, theory, and/or context. For example, if flexibility of TA is a selling feature, explain how it was utilised and why it was important for your research question.\nThis can actually be quite brief (see for example, Rance et al., 2017)"

We need to critically interrogate what we do, how and why we do it, and the impacts and influences of this on our research.\nReflexivity isn’t all navel-gazing and just thinking about yourself; it’s also about the knowledge we produce from research and how we produce it (Luttrell, 2019; Wilkinson, 1988). British feminist psychologist Sue Wilkinson (1988) offered a useful distinction between:\n\nPersonal reflexivity – how the researcher’s values shape their research and the knowledge produced;\nFunctional reflexivity – how the methods and other aspects of design shape the research and knowledge produced; and\nDisciplinary reflexivity – how academic disciplines shape knowledge production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe Braun and Clarke book from 2022 has a great activity on these 3 types to get you started (pp. 16-18, blue box)"

    "section": "Data Analysis",
    "text": "Data Analysis\nIn this section, you want to explain how the data was prepared for the analysis and detail the analysis approach\n\nDid you use specific software to transcribe? Did you use automatic transcriptions and you fixed them manually, or did you transcribe from scratch?\nHow did you anonymise the data? Did you replace or redact identifiable information? (e.g., were participants given pseudonyms; were any information replaced with broader labels or deleted; etc.)\nOutline the 6 different phases of the TA analysis approach.\n\n\nPhase 1: Dataset familiarisation\nAs the label says, you become deeply familiar with the content of your dataset. That means reading and re-reading your transcripts/ sources repeatedly. Take some notes about any analytic ideas or insights you may have, both related to each data item (e.g., interview 1, interview 2, etc.) and the dataset as a whole.\nFor the dissertation describe briefly how you familiarised yourself with the data.\n\n\nPhase 2: Data coding\nWork systematically through your dataset in a fine-grained way. Identify quotes in the data that are either interesting and/or relevant for your research question. Try to assign code label (e.g., a word or a phrase) that is analytically meaningful. You’d want to aim for single meaning code labels so that grouping them together in the next stage becomes easier. You can do this the old-fashioned way with paper and highlighters or use some funky software like NVIVO. The choice is yours.\nWhen coding, pay attention to the orientations to data coding: inductive (data-driven) vs deductive (researcher- or theory-driven) orientations. They are actually on a spectrum, and in reality, they cannot be 100% one or the other. So it’s fine to place your orientation as either predominantly inductive, predominantly deductive or to have elements of both. Whatever you decide on, it needs to fit your purpose and your theoretical framework.\nIf you are interested in the the experiences, perspectives, and meanings of the participants, you are probably taking more of an inductive approach (aligning with Big Q). Whereas if you let theory guides you in your attempt to make meaning of the data, you’d probably have a more deductive orientation.\nA second consideration is the level at which you will code meaning - semantic vs latent coding. Semantic codes capture explicitly-expressed meaning; they often stay close to the language of participants or the overt meanings of data. Latent codes focus on a deeper, more implicit level of meaning. Initial coding tends to be more semantic, but might switch to more latent coding the more familiar you become with the data. In practice, it’s neither one or the other, so again, we’re talking about a spectrum here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDespite keeping close to the language of the participant when coding semantically, you’d still need to interpret going beyond mere repetition of the participants’ words. But more about that in the Analysis section.\n\n\nThe codes are the building blocks for your analysis, which means, you’ll probably go through this phase repeatedly to refine your code labels.\nIn your dissertation, explain your orientation to the data (inductive/deductive) and the level of coding (semantic/latent).\n\n\nPhase 3: Initial theme generation\nA theme in reflexive TA is a pattern of shared meaning organised around a central concept.\nWhat you are aiming for are cohesive self-contained units of meaning in each theme. The participants will have expressed similar ideas but maybe used different examples or across different contexts. There should be no contradictions within each theme, unless your theme is about the contradiction of viewpoints or the tension that arises between them.\nIn phase 3, think about how you can group your code labels together. You will probably not be able use all code labels, and that is totally fine. When Wil and I did our initial theme generation phase, we printed out all code labels, cut them out with scissors, and moved them around 5 whiteboards (held up with magnets) until they felt about right.\nSome labels will group together more easily than others. You will probably end up with a lot of potential themes and not all of them will survive until the end. So don’t get too attached to these initial themes!!! I promise you, it will all change in phase 4 (or 5 or 6) - muahahaha. It may also happen that your initial codes were too broad and you would have to break them up (again, has to do with becoming more familiar with the data and getting a better understanding what it all means). If you are lucky, one of these broad codes may actually be a theme. You’ll never know. Bottom line is, theme generation is messy and will take some time.\n\n\nPhase 4: Theme development and review\nIn phase 4, you want to review the initial themes from phase 3 and revise them by re-engaging with all the coded data extracts, and the entire dataset. Make sure that each theme has its own boundaries and that themes don’t merge into each other. If that happens, it’s probably best to go back to phase 3 or even 2. Don’t fret if that happens, it’s all part of the process.\nIt’s also time to check whether your themes are coherent. If they are too diverse, ask yourself whether they might be subthemes of an overarching theme, or parts of different themes altogether.\nWhat you want to do in is tell a compelling story that addresses the research question that doesn’t take you too far away from the data. You need enough meaningful quotes to evidence the theme, but it’s also not about numerical frequency (i.e., x number of people said the same word). It’s about the theme conveying something important and meaningful for your research question.\nOnce you feel you have a set of distinct themes that work in relation to the coded data extracts AND tell a good story, go back to check whether your themes fit in the entire dataset. Still being prepared to let things go.\nIn the dissertation, you want to describe the process how you arrived at the final themes (e.g., phases 3 and 4). It’s ok to describe them together since you can expect these 2 phases to interweave quite a bit.\n\n\nPhase 5: Theme refining, defining and naming\n\n\nTheme 6: Writing up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe 6 phases are not sequential steps and they are not intended to be. So don’t just copy and paste these phases, personalise this section. Tell the reader exactly how you applied them. (see Braun & Clarke, 2022, pp. 35-36, blue box)"

Here is an example from a book about Chinese business practices, showing the end of one paragraph and the beginning of another: &gt; By using family titles to name their colleagues, Chinese co-workers shape their business relations in terms of the well-known conventions and roles of the family and social structure. Interaction between employers and employees also finds a basis in family-centred codes of behaviour. The author’s main point is that family relations are the basis for all Chinese social relations, including those in the workplace. The end of the first paragraph sums up the way that Chinese co-workers interact. The beginning of the second paragraph focuses on the way that Chinese employers and interact with their employees.\nThe beginning of the second paragraph mirrors and repeats words from the end of the first one. The word ‘family’ appears in both paragraphs, while the ‘employers’ and ‘employees’ of the second paragraph bears a relationship of similarity and contrast to the ‘co-workers’ of the first paragraph. The word ‘interaction’ mirrors the word ‘relations’. The phrases ‘shape their business relations in terms of’ and ‘finds a basis in’ say similar things. The author keeps his main point – all relations are modelled on family relations – before us, while working through different examples of it.\nOne way of thinking about it is that paragraphs should introduce a new point without losing sight of the old one; they should bring out the relationship between the last point and the new one. Linking words and phrases work in both directions, backwards and forwards."
